# Open questions

Decisions not made yet. When one is answered, record it in `decision-log.md`, add any resulting work to `todo.md`, and remove it here.

## How does a human settle a stuck `in_flight` receipt?

**Context.** An ambiguous failure leaves the receipt `in_flight`, and every later attempt raises `Uncertain` (see the decision log). Today the only way out is editing `agent.db` by hand.

**Options.** A command in `fleet.recovery` that lists `in_flight` receipts and marks one `failed` ("checked, it did not happen") or `ok` ("checked, it did"), writing the change and a `db.log()` event in one `db.write()`. Or a separate module.

**Blocks.** Wiring `commit_once()` into `fleet/run.py`.

**Revisit when.** Before `commit_once()` or `run_step()` is wired into `fleet/run.py` or `claude_step()`. Until then nothing writes receipts.

**Settled by.** Choosing where the command lives, what it records in the ledger, and whether it needs `--force` like a halted run.

## Should settling an irreversible action go through `approvals`?

**Context.** For an irreversible action that can neither take a key nor be checked, an `in_flight` receipt older than its timeout should be treated as an incident for a human, not retried. The schema has an `approvals` table (`run_id`, `seq`, `action`, `fingerprint`, `decision`, `decided_by`) for recording such decisions, but nothing writes to it: `fleet/doctor.py` only checks that the table exists. So the approval trail is a schema, not a working feature.

**Options.** Have the settle command (see the question above) write an `approvals` row as well as its `action.settled` event; require an `approved` row before an irreversible action runs at all; or leave `approvals` unused until a concrete action needs it.

**Blocks.** Nothing yet. Matters once an irreversible action runs through `commit_once()`.

**Settled by.** Deciding which actions count as irreversible, and whether the human decision belongs on the settle path, before the action, or both.

## Should some actions get exactly-once, not just at-most-once?

**Context.** `commit_once()` guarantees at most once. A failure after the side effect leaves the receipt `in_flight`, and the step stays blocked until a human checks. Getting exactly once across that failure needs the target system to take part, and `commit_once()` cannot involve it: it calls `action()` with no arguments, so the key never leaves `agent.db`.

**Options.** Pass the key to the action, so a target that deduplicates by key can drop a repeat. Or give an action a check that asks the target whether the effect already happened, and settle the receipt from the answer. Or stay at most once and rely on a human to settle.

**Blocks.** Nothing yet. Matters once real actions run through `commit_once()`.

**Settled by.** Knowing which actions the fleet will run and whether their targets accept a key or can be queried.

## Which actions can prove nothing ran?

**Context.** An action that knows it failed before taking effect can raise an error whose `category` is in `REFUSED`, freeing its key. Anything else stays locked.

**Options.** `shell()`: a command that is not found, or a plan step rejected before it starts. `claude_step()`: a failure on the first API request, before any tool ran.

**Blocks.** Wrapping `shell()` in `commit_once()` without locking every failed command.

**Settled by.** Listing each action's failure modes and which of them are certain.

## Should any Claude Code account or setup errors be `REFUSED`?

**Context.** `authentication_failed`, `billing_error` and the others are `LOGICAL` but not `REFUSED`, so their receipt stays `in_flight`. For a single API call that is too cautious; for a whole `claude -p` session it may be right, since the error can arrive after tools have run.

**Options.** Leave as is; add some to `REFUSED`; or let `claude_step()` decide per failure, based on whether any tool ran.

**Blocks.** Nothing yet. `claude_step()` is not wired in.

**Settled by.** Wiring `claude_step()` in and inspecting real failed runs: where the final error appears (the `result` message or the last `api_retry` event) and whether tools ran before it.

## Who runs `fleet.recovery`?

**Context.** `fleet.recovery` lists dead runs and halts over-retried ones, but nothing runs it.

**Options.** By hand; at the start of every `run.py` invocation; or a scheduler.

**Blocks.** Dead runs being noticed without a human looking.

**Settled by.** Deciding how often a dead run must be noticed, and whether `run.py` should pay that cost on every start.

**Recommended (2026-11-10, not decided).** At the start of every `fleet.run`, print the dead runs, read-only, with the `fleet.recovery` command to act on them; halting stays a manual `fleet.recovery` step. Dead runs get noticed whenever anyone starts a run, for one query per start, and starting a run never changes another run's state. A scheduler can be added if dead runs must be noticed when nobody starts runs. Caveat: `dead_runs()` returns every `failed` run however old, so the notice needs a limit (see `todo.md`, "Next").
